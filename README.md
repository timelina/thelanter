Analysys of the current site.
0. Very long domain name. Check if any better is available. thelantern.com is taken by media company and most likely wil not available in the short future.

1. thelanternoflakeforest.com registration data is:
    Registrar Registration Expiration Date: 2019-10-30T17:00:05.000Z
    Registrar: 1&1 IONOS SE
    Registrar: 1&1 IONOS SE
    Registrar IANA ID: 83
    Registrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@ionos.com
    Registrar Abuse Contact Phone: +1.8774612631

    Looks like this ionos.com is company who we need contact to move domain to another hoster.

2. Created on Weebly an even has favicon of wix on the tab. Anf has statement on the home page
"Proudly powered by Weebly".

3. Speed measuring. Mobile - 67, Desktop - 93. It's not unusual because the site is basically is empty.

4. Responsive. Site is actually kind of responsive becasue it's empty.

5. The main thing is everything not aligned, setneses are very close to each other. The site is abolytely empty. A lot of white space.

6. Proper html tags are not emplemeted. For example at the http://www.thelanternoflakeforest.com/drink-list.html Beer List should ne header tag, but it's not.

7. A lot of &nbsp (842 times) looks like a garbage on the page. But the developer used them as alignment tool for prices in the menu! So instead of styling or even of table he just cliked space button for separating menu item name from menu item price. Ugh!

9. Images are in very low quality. There are only 4 images. 
    1) Cafe's the entrance on the home page 252x190px
    2) 3 images of dishes around 250-300x250px. Bad photos by compositions and prodessionally.
    For example cup of coofee looks like somebody already drunk it and spit to it!(((

10. Also logo can be designed for the cafe in general.
